# 173. uncompress string

## Solution 1

### Code
```
function uncompress(str) {
  var stack = [];
  for (var char of str) {
    if (char != ")") {
      stack.push(char);
    } else {
      var lastChar = stack.pop();
      var out = "";
      while (lastChar != "(") {
        out = lastChar + out;
        lastChar = stack.pop();
      }
      var count = "";
      while (stack.length > 0 && !isNaN(stack[stack.length - 1])) {
        count = stack.pop() + count;
      }
      stack.push(out.repeat(count));
    }
  }
  
  return stack.join("");
}
```

### Explanation

1. Iterate through the given string until reaching the end.
2. While iterating, push all characters onto a stack until a ")" is encountered.
3. Pop the stack until "(" is the last element, combining alpha letters in reverse order.
4. After encountering "(", a numerical sequence begins.
5. Continue popping until a non-number is at the top of the stack.
6. Replicate the combined alpha character string with the obtained number and push it back onto the stack.
7. Repeat the loop from step 1.
8. Finally, return the joined stack after the loop is complete.
